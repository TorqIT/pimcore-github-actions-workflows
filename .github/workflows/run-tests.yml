# Runs Pimcore tests. Typically these are run on Pull Requests, in which case you can trigger this workflow as follows:
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
# 
# As this workflow needs to access some scripts located in this repo, you must specify a Git ref as an input. In most cases, this can simply be the same
# ref as the one you are using to call the workflow - e.g.:
# jobs:
# unit-tests-on-pr:
#   uses: TorqIT/pimcore-github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/run-tests.yml@v2
#   with:
#     REUSABLE_WORKFLOW_REF: v2
# 
# Note this workflow assumes there is a buildable PHP-FPM Docker image located in the /docker/php-fpm directory of the calling repository.
