# Outputs a GitHub Environment name based on the current branch. This workflow assumes the following branch->environment mappings:
#   develop->development
#   main->production
#   staging->staging
#
# You can call this workflow and use the output as follows:
# jobs:
#   determine-environment:
#     uses: TorqIT/shopware-github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/determine-environment-based-on-branch.yml@v2
# 
#   another-job:
#     needs: [determine-environment]
#     environment: ${{ needs.determine-environment.outputs.environment }}
#     steps:
#       - run: echo My environment is ${{ needs.determine-environment.outputs.environment }}
